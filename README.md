# Union Shop - Flutter Coursework

This repository contains the coursework project for students enrolled in the **Programming Applications and Programming Languages (M30235)** and **User Experience Design and Implementation (M32605)** modules at the University of Portsmouth.

## Project Overview

The Union Shop is a Flutter reimplementation of the existing University of Portsmouth Students' Union shop website ([https://shop.upsu.net](https://shop.upsu.net)). Students will recreate the key features and functionality of this e-commerce platform using Flutter, focusing on both web and mobile responsive design.

**Important Note:** You should NOT implement the external UPSU website ([https://www.upsu.net/](https://www.upsu.net/)) that is linked in the navigation bar of the shop. Focus only on reimplementing the shop functionality from [https://shop.upsu.net](https://shop.upsu.net).

## Current Features

This starter repository provides a minimal skeletal structure with:

- **Homepage** (`lib/main.dart`): A basic homepage with:
  - Header with navigation icons
  - Hero section with placeholder content
  - Product grid displaying 4 placeholder products
  - Footer section
- **Product Page** (`lib/product_page.dart`): A single product detail page with:

  - Basic product information (hardcoded dummy data)
  - Placeholder for size, color, quantity selectors
  - Placeholder for add to cart and buy now buttons

- **Widget Tests**: Basic tests for both pages:
  - `test/home_test.dart` - Tests for homepage components
  - `test/product_test.dart` - Tests for product page components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

#### For Windows Users

- **Git**: Download from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Flutter SDK**: Download from [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended): Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install the Flutter extension from the VS Code marketplace
- **Google Chrome**: Required for web development

#### For macOS Users

- **Git**: Usually pre-installed. If not, install via Homebrew: `brew install git`
- **Flutter SDK**: Download from [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development): Download from the Mac App Store
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended): Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install the Flutter extension from the VS Code marketplace
- **Google Chrome**: Required for web development

#### Verify Flutter Installation

After installing Flutter, verify your setup by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

**IMPORTANT: Your fork MUST be public for assessment purposes.**

1. Navigate to the original repository: [https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop](https://github.com/manighahrmani/union_shop)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page
3. Ensure the repository is set to **Public**
4. Click "Create fork"

_[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Add screenshot showing the Public option when forking]_

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

#### On Windows (PowerShell/Command Prompt)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/union_shop.git
cd union_shop
```

#### On macOS (Terminal)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/union_shop.git
cd union_shop
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Flutter packages:

#### On Windows

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

#### On macOS

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command downloads all the dependencies specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Step 4: Run the Application

This application is primarily designed to run on **web** and should be viewed in **mobile view** using browser developer tools.

#### Start the Flutter Web App

**On Windows:**

```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

**On macOS:**

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

This will launch the app in Google Chrome.

#### Enable Mobile View (Responsive Design Mode)

Once the app is running in Chrome:

1. Open Chrome DevTools:
   - **Windows**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
   - **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Option + I`
2. Click the "Toggle device toolbar" button (or press `Ctrl + Shift + M` on Windows, `Cmd + Shift + M` on macOS)

3. Select a mobile device preset (e.g., iPhone 12 Pro, Pixel 5) or set custom dimensions

### Running Tests

To run the widget tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

To run tests for a specific file:

```bash
flutter test test/home_test.dart
flutter test test/product_test.dart
```
